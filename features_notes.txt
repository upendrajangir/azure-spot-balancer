1. Check CPU and Memory limits before increasing node count
2. Check for two conditions before draining NodePool 
    a. If scaling one Node then wait for creation completion created 
    b. If scaling more than one Node and if scaling is partial successfull then calculate the load's limit and drain only calculated workload
3. Scale NodePools based on priority defined in cluster-autoscaler ConfigMap
4. Scale NodePools only if there is a workload on On-Demand NodePool otherwise skip the iteration
5. If a workload respects PDB then try to scale it first and then drain
6. What if a new deployed is scheduled after a Spot is creatd by controller? == Use PodPriority and change before draining
